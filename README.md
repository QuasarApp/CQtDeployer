## What is CQtDeployer

CQtDeployer helps you to extract all libraries your executable depends on and to create a launch script for your application.

Key differences of this program:
* Performance: this program deploys the application several times faster (up to 10 seconds)
* Flexibility: this application has flags that help you to configure the deployment for your or your project's needs
* Cross-deployment: this application supports Windows and Linux distributions. This means that you can deploy a project not only for the host platform, but also deploy a project for Windows target on Linux host and vice versa.
* Fast installers creation: Once the deployment is complete, you will receive a standalone installer for your distribution.

## Supported platforms:

* Linux 
    - deb
    - snap
    - raw binaries
    - installer
* Windows 
    - raw binaries
    - installer

## Supported processors architectures:
* x86
* x86-64
* ARM
* ARM64
